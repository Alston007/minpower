ERCOT Research Model
=================================

The ERCOT research model is a realistic model of generators in the ERCOT ISO, which includes a single bus model of 251 thermal generators, with heat rates modeled by their hourly performance during 2010, as recorded in the EPA's Clean Air Markets data. This model is publicly available for research use and as a benchmark for unit commitment performance.

Coming soon.
