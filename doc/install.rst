Installation
============


Honestly, installation can be a pain - *Windows and CPLEX are the toughest* - but it is worth it. 
The initial time investment will pay off quickly. 

If you are already a Python user or an optimization person you have probably
done some of these steps before. :doc:`Basic install on Linux <install-linux>` should take under 5min.
**minpower** is platform and :doc:`solver <solvers>` independant.

Choose your platform for instructions:
