power systems tools made beautiful
====================================

**Minpower** is an open source toolkit for 
:doc:`students<students>` and :doc:`researchers<researchers>` in power systems.
It is designed to make working with :doc:`ED <economic-dispatch>`,
:doc:`OPF <optimal-power-flow>`, and :doc:`UC <unit-commitment>` problems
:doc:`simple and intuitive<why-minpower>`. The goal is to foster :doc:`collaboration<collaborate>`
with other :doc:`researchers<researchers>` and to make learning easier for :doc:`students<students>`.



Solving problems is as easy as one command::

    minpower mycommitment/

**Minpower** creates great visualizations too, like this one for a :doc:`UC problem <unit-commitment>`:

        :width: 500 px

**Minpower** is also :doc:`powerful<researchers>`, :doc:`easy to install<install>`, and has complete :doc:`documentation<documentation>`.
